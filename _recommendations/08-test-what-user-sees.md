title:  "Test what the user sees"
---
Rather than test implementation details, it's better to test what the user sees.
In front-end development, that usually means testing DOM behavior. Use libraries
like:

* [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
* [cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/)
* [`@testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/)
* [phantomjs](https://phantomjs.org/)
* [nightmarejs](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare)
