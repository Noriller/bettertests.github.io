title:  "Test what the user sees"
---
Rather than test implementation details, it's better to test what the user sees.
In front-end development, that usually means testing DOM behavior. Use libraries
like [Kent C. Dodds's
`@testing-library`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) in
order to interact with your web application like a user.
